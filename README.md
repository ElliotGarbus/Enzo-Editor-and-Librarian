An Editor and Librarian for the Meris Enzo Multi-Voice Instrument &amp; Guitar Synthesizer.  Installation directions at the bottom of this document.

The Enzo Editor and Libraian is a full featured patch editor and librarian for the Meris Enzo Guitar Synthisizer.  The program runs on Microsoft Windows.

Requirements: 
* Meris Enzo
* Windows Computer
* MIDI connection to the Enzo (Like the Meris I/O or equivalent) Must have midi IN and Out.
* USB to midi adaptor, like the Roland UM-ONE
* Note: It looks the DisasterArea qCONNECT should work, but I have not tested it.

To get started click on the red 'connect' button, Make sure your Enzo is setup as as described in the Connect Dialog.  Select the MIDI interface device you are using to connect your PC to your Enzo, and select the MIDI Ch programed on your Enzo, and click connect.  If you started the program prior to connecting your USB to MIDI adaptor, press scan.  The program will remember to last connection you have made.
